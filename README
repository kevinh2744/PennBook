Instructions for running the code:

	To populate the articles and inverted_articles tables,
	cd to newsfeed and run "mvn exec:java@loader"

	To run an adsorption job to populate the recommendations and
	article_weights tables, cd to newsfeed and run "mvn compile", 
	"mvn package" and "mvn exec:java@livy". Make sure to use a valid URI in 
	AdsorptionLivy.java to submit the job.

	Install dependencies through "npm install".
	
	Run "node app.js" in the home directory to run the app. If deploying
	locally (not on EC2), go to app.js and change the port number in
	http.listen() to 8080. Also go the allChats.ejs and singleChat.ejs
	views to change the ec2 urls used for socket.io to http://localhost:8080/.
